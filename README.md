# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) devised by the British [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician) [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970. It is a [zero-player game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game), meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
